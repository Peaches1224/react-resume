                Born and raised in San Francisco, I am a Software developer transitioning from a Cosmetologist and Marketing Coordinator. Recently, I completed an intensive training program focused on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React amongst other skills. I'm also well versed in Git and Github, as well as working remotely across time zones.

                I love aesthetics and working with people and am always willing and open to learning new techniques. I consider myself very detail oriented with an eye for design. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I would fit into your organization. I am energetic, enthusiastic, hardworking, and quick to learn.
